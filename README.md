# Traffic 
![image](./examples.pdf)
A new traffic anomaly dataset is now public on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cofMJGglil4vddrq_unuy7EEhthMYtuq) or [Baidu Cloud]()

The proposed Traffic dataset contains a total of about 25 hours videos, average 1075 frames per clip. The anomalies randomly occur in each clip, about 80 frames in average. 500 traffic surveillance videos are saved and annotated for anomaly detection, with 250 abnormal and normal videos respectively. The whole dataset is randomly partitioned into two parts: training set with 400 videos, and test set with 100 videos.

Due to the storage restriction, we have uploaded the extracted frames(frames_part_1.zip & frames_part_2.zip) till now. In examples.pdf, we show an example of each anomaly class we collected. The split of training anf testing set will come soon, along with the annotations.
